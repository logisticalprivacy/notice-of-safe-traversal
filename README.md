# Notice of safe traversal

This document provides plausible deniability at crossing points into and out of authoritarian countries.

To use this document:

* Print out the PDF

* Come up with a strong new device password and divide it into three parts. Do *not* memorize the new password.

* Pass two parts of the password to a party in the country of departure (via an in-person handoff) and in the destination country (via a secure channel), making it clear that you wish to be given the destination part of the password *only* after safe arrival and departure from the airport or other port of entry

* Write your portion of the password on the printed PDF, sign it, and date it. 

* Change the device password to match the new password.

* Travel as normal. Only provide the printed PDF if you are asked for a password, which is statistically unlikely to happen.
