# Notice of safe traversal

This document provides plausible deniability for device passwords at crossing points into and out of authoritarian countries.

To use this document:

* Print out the PDF.

* Come up with a strong new device password and divide it into three parts. Do *not* memorize the new password.

* Pass two parts of the password to a party in the country of departure (via an in-person handoff) and in the destination country (via a secure channel), making it clear that you wish to be given the destination part of the password *only* after safe departure from the destination airport or other port of entry -- in other words, not just after exiting customs, but after exiting the airport itself.

* Memorize your portion of the password.

* Optional: Write your portion of the password on the printed PDF, sign it, and date it. 

* Change the device password to match the new password.

* Once you have received confirmation that the two other parties have their password parts, destroy any local documentation of those parts of the password. 

* Travel as normal. Only provide the printed PDF if you are asked for a password, which is statistically unlikely to happen. 

* Once you have arrived at your hotel, homestay or other destination, retrieve the password parts from your host and the third person.

* Repeat the steps above on the return trip.
